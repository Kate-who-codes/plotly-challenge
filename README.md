## Belly Button Biodiversity (Plotly-Challenge)

Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

4. Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

5. Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

6. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

7. Use otu_ids for the x values.

8. Use sample_values for the y values.

9. Use sample_values for the marker size.

10. Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

11. Use otu_labels for the text values.

12. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

13. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

14. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
